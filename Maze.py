    # wall at that point and carve a passage through to the adjacent cell, but only if the adjacent cell has not been
    # visited yet. This becomes the new current cell. If all adjacent cells have been visited, back up to the last
    # cell that has un-carved walls and repeat. The algorithm ends when the process has backed all the way up to the
    # starting point.
